**Deauthentication Attack (deauthentication_attack_script.py)** - This script is meant to be a user-friendly version of a deauthentication attack. The user is required to know their network interface that they plan to target (most commonly wlan0) and how many deauthentication packets they plan to send, but the rest is automated for them, as well as a display of the MAC addresses on the network.
